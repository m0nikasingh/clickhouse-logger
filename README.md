# Blog demo

This demo reads some demo logs generated by vector.dev and writes it into clickhouse.
The docker-compose would spawn up 3 containers:

1. Vector.dev to produce the demo logs and write to ClickHouse
2. ClickHouse container to store logs
3. Grafana to visualize the logs

Pre-requisite:
- docker

Getting started:

Bring up the containers using docker compose
```
docker compose up
```
And visit http://localhost:3000/ and open the `Demo logs dashboard`, play around
